# Party


Work with API data
- Understand and use React components
- Understand and use "props" in React
- Use map to render a collection of components in React

Explorer Mode:
- Use the API to fetch the data and render it on the page, rather than the supplied JSON file.
- You should have at least two components; App and Movie.
- Render at least the title, poster image, and plot overview. Feel free to include other pieces of the data.
- Try to capture a 1980's or early 90's aesthetic when you style your page. Have fun with it!
